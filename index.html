     <p class="right">Video editing is the process of manipulating and rearranging video shots to create a new
     work. In the film industry editing is considered part of the post-production process that is
     it is a process taking place after production, or the filming/collection of imagery Other
     tasks included in post-production are color correction (adding a mood to the film using
     color, contrast, etc.), and sound mixing (this occurs after audio has been recorded).
     Linear video editing uses video tape and is edited in a very linear way. Several video clips from different tapes are recorded to one single tape in the order that they will appear.
     Non-linear editing systems (NLE) allow video to be edited on computers with specialized software. This process is not destructive to the raw video footage and is done by using programs such as DaVinci Resolve, Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro.
     Offline editing is the process by which raw footage is copied from an original source, without affecting the original film stock or video tape. Once the editing is complete, the original media is then re-assembled in the online editing stage.
     Online editing is the process of reassembling the edit to full resolution video after an offline edit has been performed. It is done in the final stage of a video production.
     Cloud-based editing is the process of utilising the internet to work with content remotely, collaboratively or of a time-critical nature such as editing of live sports events in real-time using video proxies (lower resolution copies) of original material.
     Vision mixing is used when working within live television and video production environments. A vision mixer is used to cut live feed coming from several cameras in real time.</p>

     <p class="left">Gaming refers to playing electronic games, whether through consoles, computers, mobile phones or another medium altogether. Gaming is a nuanced term that suggests regular gameplay, possibly as a hobby. Although traditionally a solitary form of relaxation, online multiplayer video games have made gaming a popular group activity as well.

     A person who is into gaming is often called a gamer or hardcore gamer.
     Gaming is the practice of playing video games. The term may also refer to betting, especially online. This article focuses just on the term when it refers to video games.

     Somebody who is gaming may be playing video or electronic games using a console, mobile phone, VR (virtual reality) goggles, or computer. The gamer is typically a regular player who enjoys electronic games as a hobby. There are also professional gamers; they make a living in the world of esports. In fact, some of them are now millionaires.
     Gaming was initially a solitary activity. However, over the past decade, online video games involving multiple players have become extremely popular. For many players, the activity has become an opportunity to socialize. In fact, for some of them, it is their only opportunity to interact with others, which is why they are always eager to find new online gaming communities.</p>
